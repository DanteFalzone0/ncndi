# This is a list of simple MPL expressions.
# You should be able to pipe this file into
# test_calculate and see the results of the
# expressions, like so:
#
#     cat calc.txt | ./test_calculate
#
# I've tested test_calculate,  and although
# it can choke on malformed input, it tends
# to work perfectly with no memory leaks if
# it's given well-formed expressions.
